      <h2>Label Guide</h2>

      <p>
      Finding an issue to work on, that's right for you, can be the hardest obstacle in being able to contribute to open source. A new codebase can be hard to get started with, even for experienced developers, let alone someone who is just starting. It's easier to pick up something small and trivial or work on a bit of documentation until understanding grows and there is more familiarity with a project.

      <p>
      With labelling issues properly, you can help people get started!
